    .. container:: sd-badge-next-text

        We present a reduced-basis approach for optimal control problems with
        constraints, which for a required tolerance seems to deliver lower
        dimensional RB spaces than reported in the literature so far. Moreover,
        the approach allows to prove an error equivalence similar to those known
        from finite element a posteriori error analysis of PDE constrained
        optimization problems. Numerical test confirm our theoretical findings.

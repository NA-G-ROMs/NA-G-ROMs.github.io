        Projection-based (linear) model reduction for linear dynamical systems
        is an effective tool for capturing dynamics of large systems using
        parsimonious linear representations in a lower-dimensional space. There
        are myriad strategies for constructing such reduced-order models, and
        the effectiveness of reduced order modeling is often computationally
        analyzed by inspecting the decay or decay rate of the Hankel singular
        values of the system.
        
        In this talk weâ€™ll present new analysis for a straightforward greedy
        construction of a rational function approximation for the transfer
        function of stable large-scale dynamical systems. This new analysis,
        which immediately reveals corresponding algorithms, provides explicit
        rational approximability estimates of transfer functions in the
        H-infinity norm. The estimates involve sectorial properties of the
        system matrices, which provide a quantification of notions of
        dissipation-dominance or transport-dominance in dynamical systems. The
        theoretical constructions correspond to explicit Galerkin
        projection-based reduced order models of the original system, and hence
        this analysis provides concrete estimates of Hankel singular value
        decay. The framework we discuss is a paradigm that forges concrete
        relationships between rational approximation, Kolmogorov n-widths, and
        Galerkin projection-based model reduction.

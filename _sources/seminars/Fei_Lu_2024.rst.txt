        Reguarlization is crucial to produce stable accurate solutions for
        ill-posed inverse problems in the form of Ax=b. Although regularization
        has been intensively studied for more than a century, a remaining
        challgene to properly regularize the problem with varying A and b. Such
        problems arise in data-driven modeling, where even the space of x is
        either unknown or depends on the basis functions and discretization. We
        introduce a data-adaptive RKHS for regularization. The RKHS is
        determined by the inverse problem and the data, and it can be either
        finite or infinite dimension. We will discuss a direct method based on
        matrix decomposition, as well as a scalable iterative method based on a
        new generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization. In both direct and
        iterative methods, the RKHS regularizer leads to convergent estimators
        that are robust to noise, outperforming the widely used L2 or l2
        regularizers. We demonstrate the applications in learning kernels in
        operators, solving Fredholm equations of the first kind, and image
        deblurring.

        Nonlinear parametrizations such as deep neural networks can circumvent
        the Kolmogorov barrier of classical model reduction methods that seek
        linear approximations in subspaces. However, numerically fitting
        ("training") nonlinear parametrizations is challenging because (a)
        training data need to be sampled (residual measurements) to estimate
        well the population loss with the empirical loss and (b) training errors
        quickly accumulate and amplify over time. This work introduces Neural
        Galerkin schemes that build on the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle
        for training nonlinear parametrizations sequentially in time. The
        accumulation of error over the sequential-in-time training is addressed
        by updating only randomized sparse subsets of the parameters, which is
        motivated by dropout that addresses a similar issue of overfitting due
        to neuron co-adaptation. Additionally, an adaptive sampling scheme is
        proposed that judiciously tests the residual so that few residual
        calculations are sufficient for training. In numerical experiments with
        a wide range of evolution equations, the proposed scheme outperforms
        classical linear methods, especially for problems with
        transport-dominated features and high-dimensional spatial domains.

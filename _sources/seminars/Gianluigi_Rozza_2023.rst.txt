        We provide the state of the art of Reduced Order Methods (ROM) for
        parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), and we focus on some
        perspectives in their current trends and developments, with a special
        interest in parametric problems arising in offline-online Computational
        Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Efficient parametrisations (random inputs,
        geometry, physics) are very important to be able to properly address an
        offline-online decoupling of the computational procedures and to allow
        competitive computational performances. Current ROM developments in CFD
        include: (i) a better use of stable high fidelity methods, to enhance
        the quality of the reduced model too, also in presence of bifurcations
        and loss of uniqueness of the solution itself, (ii) capability to
        incorporate turbulence models and to increase the Reynolds number; (iii)
        more efficient sampling techniques to reduce the number of the basis
        functions, retained as snapshots, as well as the dimension of online
        systems; (iv) the improvements of the certification of accuracy,
        established on residual based error bounds, and of the stability
        factors, as well as (v) the guarantee of the stability of the
        approximation with proper space enrichments. All the previous aspects
        are quite relevant – and often challenging – in CFD problems to focus on
        real time simulations for complex parametric industrial, environmental
        and biomedical flow problems, or even in a control flow setting with
        data assimilation and uncertainty quantification. Some model problems
        will be illustrated by focusing on few benchmark study cases, for
        example on simplefluid-structure interaction problems and on shape
        optimisation, applied to some industrial and environmental problems of
        interest.

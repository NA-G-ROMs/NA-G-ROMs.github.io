        In this talk we address the stability of the pressure discretisation for
        Reduced Order Models (ROMs) of incompressible flows. For Galerkin
        discretisations of incompressible fluids, the discrete inf-sup condition
        for the duality velocity - pressure gradient can be achieved to ROMs by
        adding velocity supremisers (the Riesz representation of the pressure
        gradient on the velocity space). However, it is rather costly and
        several alternative strategies can be carried on. Among them,
        stabilisation techniques or post-processing of the pressure. On one side
        we shall present several stabilisation procedures that ensure the well
        posedness of the reduced problem, in norms weaker than the :math:`L^2`
        norm for the pressure. We apply this technique to the Reduced-Basis
        solution of the Smagorinsky turbulence model. On another hand we shall
        study a post-processing of the pressure from divergence-free POD-ROM
        velocity. We prove error estimates again in a norm weaker than the
        :math:`L^2` for the pressure.

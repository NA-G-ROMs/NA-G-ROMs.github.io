        In this talk, I will give an introduction to the stochastic and the
        statistical reduced-order models. These reduced-order models play an
        essential role in facilitating the computations of many scientific
        problems in geophysics, engineering, neuroscience, material science,
        etc. They also advance the understanding of key physics. I will start
        with building various stochastic reduced-order models and present
        methods to systematically determine these models. I will illustrate
        their unique features in different applications. Then, I will link these
        reduced-order models with efficient data assimilation and statistical
        forecast. Related to these topics, I will discuss statistical
        reduced-order models, which are quite useful for uncertainty
        quantification. Finally, I will show one exciting example of how these
        reduced-order models can reversely help develop more sophisticated
        physical models that characterize a real atmosphere-ocean phenomenon.

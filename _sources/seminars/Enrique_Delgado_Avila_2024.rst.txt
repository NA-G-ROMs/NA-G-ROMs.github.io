        In this talk we adress different approaches for "a posteriori" error
        estimators for the Greedy algorithm. We deal with LES models for which
        we construct a posteriori error estimators by two different approaches.
        On one hand, we consider the classical Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart theory for
        non-linear operators in order to construct the a posteriori error
        estimator. On the other hand, we consider a novel approach, in which the
        a posteriori error estimator is based on the Kolmogorov energy cascade
        theory. We present numerical results for different test cases where we
        show the reliability of both kind of estimators.

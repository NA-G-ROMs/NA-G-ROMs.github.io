        Using nonlinear projections and preserving structure in model order
        reduction (MOR) are currently active research fields. In this paper, we
        provide a novel differential geometric framework for model reduction on
        smooth manifolds, which emphasizes the geometric nature of the objects
        involved. The crucial ingredient is the construction of an embedding for
        the low-dimensional submanifold and a compatible reduction map, for
        which we discuss several options. Our general framework allows capturing
        and generalizing several existing MOR techniques, such as structure
        preservation for Lagrangian- or Hamiltonian dynamics, and using
        nonlinear projections that are, for instance, relevant in
        transport-dominated problems. The joint abstraction can be used to
        derive shared theoretical properties for different methods, such as an
        exact reproduction result. To connect our framework to existing work in
        the field, we demonstrate that various techniques for data-driven
        construction of nonlinear projections can be included in our framework.

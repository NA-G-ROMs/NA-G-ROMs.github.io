        Delay differential equations (DDEs) are widely used in many applied
        fields to account for delayed responses of the modeled systems to
        internal/external factors. In contrast to ODEs, the phase space
        associated even with a scalar DDE is infinite-dimensional. Oftentimes,
        it is desirable to have low-dimensional ODE systems to approximate the
        DDE dynamics. In this talk, we present a new Galerkin scheme for general
        nonlinear DDEs. The main ingredient is a type of polynomials that are
        orthogonal under an inner product with a point mass. The associated
        Galerkin scheme enjoys some nice properties that help reduce the
        derivation of the convergence results to basic functional analysis
        exercises. Analytic formulas are available within this approach, which
        help simplify the numerical treatment. We will also discuss further
        dimension reduction using the center manifold technique for DDE
        bifurcation analysis. It leads to a rigorous and computationally
        efficient way to approximate the Stuart-Landau normal forms for the
        considered DDEs. We will show how insights gained from such reduced
        systems can help design stochastic perturbations to induce chaos from
        the otherwise periodic DDE dynamics. The approach will be illustrated
        using a cloud-rain DDE model in the context of Hopf bifurcations and
        noise-driven chaos.

        The first part of the talk is devoted to recent developments of the
        construction and numerical analysis of finite element methods that
        satisfy discrete maximum principles (DMPs) for
        convection-diffusion-reaction problems. It turns out that many of the
        methods that satisfy DMPs and compute at the same time accurate
        solutions have been proposed only quite recently.
        
        In the second part of the talk a POD-ROM method for
        convection-diffusion-reaction problems that is augmented with a SUPG
        stabilization is presented. An a priori error analysis which leads to
        robust estimates is discussed and an approach for a posteriori error
        estimation is sketched. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of
        the SUPG-ROM method.

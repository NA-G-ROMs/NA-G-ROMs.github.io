        A space-time-parameters structure of the parametric dynamical systems
        encourages the application of tensor methods for defining reduced-order
        models. Within a tensor-based ROM framework, traditional dimension
        reduction techniques like the matrix SVD yield to a low-rank tensor
        decomposition (LRTD). This extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal
        decomposition ROMs using tensors enhances both the practical efficiency
        of the ROM and its suitability for rigorous error analysis when applied
        to parametric PDEs. I intend to present the new LRTD-ROM framework and
        explain an error analysis for an abstract linear parabolic problem.
        Through this analysis, we will observe that the error estimation relies
        more on the smoothness of the parameterized manifold of solutions rather
        than on the Kolmogorov n-widths.

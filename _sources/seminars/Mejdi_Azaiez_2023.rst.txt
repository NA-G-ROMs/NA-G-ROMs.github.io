        We introduce a technique for the reduced order approximation of
        parametric symmetric elliptic partial differential equations. This
        method is analogous to the best approximation property of the Proper
        Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) subspaces, excepting that in our case the
        norm, intrinsic to the problem, is parameter-depending, and then the POD
        optimal sub-spaces cannot be characterized by means of a spectral
        problem. We apply a deflation technique to build a series of
        approximating solutions on finite-dimensional optimal subspaces,
        directly in the on-line step. We prove that the partial sums converge to
        the continuous solutions in mean quadratic elliptic norm. We prove the
        linear convergence of the Power Iterate method applied to compute the
        modes of the PGD expansion, for both symmetric and non-symmetric
        problems, when the data are small. We also find a spectral convergence
        ratio of the PGD expansion in the mean parametric norm, for meaningful
        parametric elliptic problems. We end the talk by proving that the PGD
        modes of the discretized problem converge to the PGD modes of the
        continuous problem, with respect to the discretization of both the
        parameter set and the elliptic problem afforded. When possible, we will
        assess our theoretical results by giving some numerical experiments.

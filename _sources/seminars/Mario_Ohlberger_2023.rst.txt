    .. container:: sd-badge-next-text

        Model order reduction for parameterized systems has gained a lot of
        attention in the last two decades. In this talk we will focus on
        projection based model order reduction and their efficient application
        to solve large scale PDE constrained optimization problems. We will
        discuss learning strategies, such as adaptive enrichment as well as a
        combination of reduced order models with machine learning approaches in
        the context of time dependent problems. Concepts of rigorous
        certification and convergence will be presented, as well as numerical
        experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches.

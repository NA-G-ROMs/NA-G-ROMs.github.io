        In the talk problems in optimal design and control are considered.
        Reduced-order modeling is applied to speed-up the numerical solution.
        A-posteriori error estimation is utilized to ensure a sufficient
        accuracy of the reduced-order (suboptimal) solution. Here, adaptive
        strategies are essential to choose a proper reduced-order approximation,
        where the dimension of the reduced-order spaces is kept as small as
        necessary. New strategies in constructing the reduced-order spaces are
        proposed which does not require any computationally expensive offline
        phase.

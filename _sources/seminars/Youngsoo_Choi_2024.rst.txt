        A computationally demanding physical simulation often presents a
        significant impediment to scientific and technological progress.
        Fortunately, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and artificial
        intelligence have given rise to data-driven methods that can expedite
        these simulations. For instance, a well-trained 2D convolutional deep
        neural network can provide a 100,000-fold acceleration in solving
        complex problems like Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. However,
        conventional black-box ML models lack the integration of fundamental
        physics principles, such as the conservation of mass, momentum, and
        energy. Consequently, they often run afoul of critical physical laws,
        raising concerns among physicists. These models attempt to compensate
        for the absence of physics information by relying on vast amounts of
        data. Additionally, they suffer from various drawbacks, including a lack
        of structure-preservation, computationally intensive training phases,
        reduced interpretability, and susceptibility to extrapolation issues. To
        address these shortcomings, we propose an approach that incorporates
        physics into the data-driven framework. This integration occurs at
        different stages of the modeling process, including the sampling and
        model-building phases. A physics-informed greedy sampling procedure
        minimizes the necessary training data while maintaining target accuracy.
        A physics-guided data-driven model not only preserves the underlying
        physical structure more effectively but also demonstrates greater
        robustness in extrapolation compared to traditional black-box ML models.
        We will showcase numerical results in areas such as hydrodynamics,
        particle transport, plasma physics, pore-collapse, and 3D printing to
        highlight the efficacy of these data-driven approaches. The advantages
        of these methods will also become apparent in multi-query
        decision-making applications, such as design optimization.

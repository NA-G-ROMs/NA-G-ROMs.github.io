        Reduced Order Models (ROM) in computational mechanics aim at solving
        problems approximating the solution in spaces of very low dimension. The
        idea is to first solve the Full Order Model (FOM) in a high-fidelity
        space and, from its solution, construct the basis of the ROM space. We
        shall concentrate on the case in which the FOM is solved by means of a
        Finite Element (FE) method and the ROM is obtained from a Proper
        Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of a series of ’snapshots’, i.e.,
        high-fidelity solutions obtained for example at different time instants
        or for different values of a parameter of the problem to be solved. This
        way, the ROM solution can be considered to belong to a subspace of the
        FOM FE space.
        
        The Variational Multi-scale (VMS) idea is to split the unknown into the
        resolvable component, in our case living in the FE space, and a
        remainder, called sub-grid scale (SGS). After setting a problem for the
        SGS, this problem is what is in fact approximated somehow, so that the
        SGS can be expressed in terms of the FE solution. When the resulting
        expression is inserted into the equation projected into the FE space,
        one ends up with a problem for the FE unknown with enhanced stability
        problems. The first purpose of this talk is to explain why the VMS
        strategy can be applied quite naturally to the ROM approximation when
        this is based in a FE method to approximate flow problems. This yields a
        stable ROM problem.
        
        The second objective of the talk is to explain how accuracy can be
        improved using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Motivated by the
        structure of the stabilization terms arising from VMS, an additional
        correcting term is added to enhance accuracy. This term is an ANN
        trained with the snapshots, i.e., the high-fidelity solutions used to
        construct the basis of the ROM. Some numerical examples are presented
        showing the improvement obtained with the correcting terms.

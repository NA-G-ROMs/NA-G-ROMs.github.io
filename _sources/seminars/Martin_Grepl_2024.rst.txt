        Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a well established approach to solve
        infinite horizon optimal control problems. Since optimization over an
        infinite time horizon is, in general, infeasible, the method determines
        a suboptimal feedback control by repeatedly solving finite time optimal
        control problems.
        
        In this talk, we consider systems governed by parametrized parabolic
        partial differential equations and employ the reduced basis method (RB)
        as a low-dimensional surrogate model for the finite time optimal control
        problem. The reduced order optimal control serves as the feedback
        control for the MPC of the original large-scale system. Based on
        rigorous and efficiently computable a posteriori error bounds we are
        able to guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system using
        the RB-MPC approach. We also propose an adaptive strategy to choose the
        optimal horizon length of the finite time optimal control problem.
        Finally, we consider an extension to nonlinear problems based on the
        Schl√∂gl model. Numerical results are presented for the linear and
        nonlinear case to validate our approach.

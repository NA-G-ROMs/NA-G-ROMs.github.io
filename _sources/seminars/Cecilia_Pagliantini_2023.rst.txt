        Hamiltonian systems describe conservative phenomena ranging from
        transport problems to conservation laws in fluid dynamics and plasma
        physics. The development of reduced order models for Hamiltonian systems
        is challenged by several factors: (i) failing to preserve the geometric
        structure encoding the physical properties of the dynamics might lead to
        instabilities and unphysical behaviors of the resulting approximate
        solutions; (ii) the slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width of
        transport-dominated and non-dissipative phenomena demands large reduced
        spaces to achieve sufficiently accurate approximations; and (iii)
        nonlinear operators require hyper-reduction techniques that preserve the
        gradient structure of the flow velocity. We will discuss how to address
        these aspects via structure-preserving nonlinear model order reduction.
        The gist of the proposed method is to adapt in time an approximate
        low-dimensional phase space endowed with the geometric structure of the
        full model and to ensure that the hyper-reduced flow retains the
        physical properties of the original model.

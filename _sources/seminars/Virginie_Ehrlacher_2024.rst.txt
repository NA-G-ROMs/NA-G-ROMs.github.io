        Electronic structure calculations involving a large number of electrons
        are computationally very demanding. For example, in the design of
        machine-learned interatomic potentials for materials or molecules,
        generating ab initio data for a large number of atomic configurations is
        often the most time-consuming part. Therefore, there is still a strong
        need in reducing the computational cost of such methods.
        
        In this talk, I will present recent work which aims at efficiently
        computing approximate solutions to electronic structire calculation
        problems. The latter read as eigenvalue problems parametrized by the
        nuclei positions within a molecule using a nonlinear reduced basis
        method based on optimal transport. Indeed, standard linear reduced-order
        modeling techniques do not work in the present context due to the
        localisation of the electronic density around the nuclei. However, by
        combining a sparse representation of the solution as a mixture of
        well-chosen functions with optimal transport methods, we obtain accurate
        nonlinear reduced-order models which enable to nicely approximate the
        solution of the problem. I will present theoretical results on the
        mathematical analysis of the approach on a 1D toy model, in particular
        on the decay rate of linear and nonlinear Kolmogorov widths. I will
        finally discuss possible extensions to larger systems.
        
        This is joint work with Maxime Daléry, Geneviève Dusson and Alexei
        Lozinski.

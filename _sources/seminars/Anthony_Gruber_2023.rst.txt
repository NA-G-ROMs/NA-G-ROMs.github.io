    .. container:: sd-badge-next-text

        The dynamics of a physical system are implicitly constrained by
        conservation laws which are largely responsible for the behavior of its
        solutions. However, standard methods of model reduction frequently used
        in practice violate these relationships, leading to artificial numerical
        instability and poor generalization performance in the resulting
        low-order surrogates. To remedy this, some of the authorsâ€™ recent work
        on intrusive and non-intrusive model reduction for Hamiltonian and
        metriplectic systems is presented. Particularly, it is shown that
        ensuring an appropriate variational structure in the reduced model leads
        to exact property-preservation, improved stability, and robust long-time
        behavior, at computational costs reasonably competitive with
        general-purpose methods.

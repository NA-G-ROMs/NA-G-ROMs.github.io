    .. container:: sd-badge-next-text

        We discuss the development of optimization-based (one-shot) procedures
        for component-based (CB) model order reduction (MOR) of parametric
        nonlinear PDEs. We first devise a constrained optimization procedure
        that minimizes jumps at componentsâ€™ interfaces subject to the
        (approximate) satisfaction of the PDE in each component. Then, we
        introduce suitable low-dimensional control variables to recast the
        optimization problem into an unconstrained nonlinear least-square
        problem that can be effectively solved using the Gauss-Newton method
        (GNM). We consider both overlapping and non-overlapping domain
        partitions; furthermore, we apply our method to a nonlinear neo-Hookean
        problem and to an incompressible Navier-Stokes problem, to demonstrate
        its effectiveness.

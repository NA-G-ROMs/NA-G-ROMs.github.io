        Bifurcating phenomena, i.e. sudden changes in the system’s qualitative
        behavior linked to the solution’s non-uniqueness, naturally arise in
        several fields. We discuss both intrusive and non-intrusive Reduced
        Order Models for reconstructing bifurcation diagrams, whose associated
        cost is unaffordable using high-fidelity simulations. POD and deflated
        Greedy approaches are investigated and compared with data-driven ones
        based on neural networks. The proposed methodologies are tested on
        classical bifurcating benchmarks in fluid dynamics held by the
        Navier-Stokes equations and linked to Coanda’s effect.

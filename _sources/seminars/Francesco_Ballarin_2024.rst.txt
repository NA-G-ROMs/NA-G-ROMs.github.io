        Numerical stabilization is often used to alleviate the spurious
        oscillations generally produced by full order models (FOMs) in
        under-resolved or marginally-resolved simulations of
        convection-dominated flows modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes
        equations. However, when dealing with reduced order models (ROMs) of
        convection-dominated, marginally-resolved flows, the role of numerical
        stabilization is still not well understood. Further challanges arise
        when interested not only in the simulation of the flow itself, but also
        on its control, for instance to achieve a desired target configuration.
        
        The presentation will be divided in two parts, which discuss two
        different regularization techniques. In the first part of the talk,
        based on (Strazzullo et al. 2023), we present an evolve-filter-relax
        regularized ROM and apply it to a feedback control problem. In the
        second part of the presentation we establish a novel regularized ROM,
        based on approximate deconvolution and introduced in (Sanfilippo et al.
        2023).

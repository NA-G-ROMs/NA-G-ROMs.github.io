        Dynamic optimization problems arise in many applications including
        optimal flow control, full waveform inversion, and medical imaging,
        where they are plagued by significant computational challenges. For
        example, memory is often a limiting factor on the size of problems one
        can solve since the evaluation of derivatives requires the entire state
        trajectory. Additionally, many applications employ nonsmooth
        regularizers such as the :math:`L^1`-norm or the total variation as well
        as auxiliary constraints on the optimization variables. In this talk, we
        introduce a novel trust-region algorithm for minimizing the sum of a
        smooth, nonconvex function and a nonsmooth, convex function that
        addresses these two challenges. Our algorithm employs randomized
        sketching to store a compressed version of the state trajectory for use
        in derivative computations. By allowing the trust-region algorithm to
        adaptively learn the rank of the state sketch, we arrive at a provably
        convergent method with near optimal memory requirements. We demonstrate
        the efficacy of our method on a parabolic PDE-constrained optimization
        problem with measure-valued control variables.

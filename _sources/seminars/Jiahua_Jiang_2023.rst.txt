        We develop hybrid projection methods for computing solutions to
        large-scale inverse problems, where the solution represents a sum of
        different stochastic components. Such scenarios arise in many imaging
        applications (e.g., anomaly detection in atmospheric emissions
        tomography) where the reconstructed solution can be represented as a
        combination of two or more components and each component contains
        different smoothness or stochastic properties. In a deterministic
        inversion or inverse modeling framework, these assumptions correspond to
        different regularization terms for each solution in the sum. Although
        various prior assumptions can be included in our framework, we focus on
        the scenario where the solution is a sum of a sparse solution and a
        smooth solution. For computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid
        projection methods for solution decomposition that are based on a
        combined flexible and generalized Golub-Kahan processes. This approach
        integrates techniques from the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization
        and the flexible Krylov methods. The benefits of the proposed methods
        are that the decomposition of the solution can be done iteratively, and
        the regularization terms and regularization parameters are adaptively
        chosen at each iteration. Numerical results from photoacoustic
        tomography and atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the potential
        for these methods to be used for anomaly detection.

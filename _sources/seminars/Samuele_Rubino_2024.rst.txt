        In this talk, we address an efficient time-splitting approximation of
        the Navier-Stokes equations with open boundary conditions in the
        framework of POD-ROMs. The motivation to develop this ROM comes from the
        high computational cost of solving the Navier-Stokes equations (with
        open boundary conditions), especially in a many-query context, where a
        numerical simulation has to be performed for different values of
        parameters. The time-splitting scheme proposed allows to solve the
        Navier-Stokes equations with open boundary conditions reducing the size
        of the computational domain and, as consequence, the offline
        computational cost. Therefore, the ROM offers a greater computational
        advantage over this scheme.

        In this talk we study numerical approximations to the incompressible
        Navier-Stokes equations by means of proper orthogonal decomposition
        (POD) methods. Several questions are considered such as the influence of
        including snapshots that approach the velocity time derivative and the
        influence of considering different discretizations for the nonlinear
        term in the full order model and the reduced order model. Error bounds
        with constants independent of the Reynolds numbers are obtained in the
        numerical analysis.

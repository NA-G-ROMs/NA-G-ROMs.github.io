        In modern computational chemistry, large-scale computations are often
        required to analyze electronic, atomistic, or molecular structures, each
        possessing a substantial number of degrees of freedom. To optimize
        computational efficiency, a streamlined model that tracks only
        representative degrees of freedom to simulate overall dynamics is
        preferred. For molecular models, the key is the accurate reproduction of
        both the marginal density and the time correlation function in these
        reduced-order models. On the other hand, electron dynamics typically
        emphasizes the use of reduced-order modeling to eliminate variables
        linked to the quantum bath. The challenge is to faithfully incorporate
        the influence of the bath, while still retain long-range interactions.
        This talk introduces subspace projection techniques to tackle these
        challenges and establishes a direct link with the Mori-Zwanzig
        framework.

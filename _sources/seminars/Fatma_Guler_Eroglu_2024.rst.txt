        We propose, analyze and test a post-processing implementation of a
        projection-based variational multiscale (VMS) method with proper
        orthogonal decomposition (POD) for the incompressible Navier-Stokes
        equations. The projection-based VMS stabilization is added as a separate
        post-processing step to the standard POD approximation, and since the
        stabilization step is completely decoupled, the method can easily be
        incorporated into existing codes, and stabilization parameters can be
        tuned independent from the time evolution step. Then, we extend the
        VMS-POD methodology for Darcy-Brinkman equations with double-diffusive
        convection.
        
        In the second part of the presentation, we investigate POD-G modelling
        to solve fully nonlinear potential flow equations (FNPF) to achieve
        faster turn-around time than spectral element method (SEM). We present
        results for several numerical tests on benchmark problems which show the
        proposed method’s effectiveness.

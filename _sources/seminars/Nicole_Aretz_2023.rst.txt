        Mathematical models, such as partial differential equations (PDEs), are
        widely used to predict the behavior of a physical system. However, any
        model can only provide an approximation to the underlying physics, and
        can be subject to a variety of model errors, such as uncertainties in
        the loading or initial condition. Variational Data Assimilation can be
        used to improve models through the incorporation of measurement data.
        Here, the inverse solution requires many evaluations of the full-order
        forward model, leading to large computational costs. When the described
        system configuration is flexible such that the inverse solution needs to
        be computed for a variety of hyper-parameters, the computational cost
        becomes prohibitive.
        
        In this talk we present reduced basis (RB) approximations to the 3D-VAR
        and 4D-VAR variational data assimilation methods posed over
        hyper-parameterized PDEs with linear model uncertainties. An extension
        to non-linear inverse problems is shown. After a preparatory offline
        phase, the RB-3D-VAR and RB-4D-VAR methods can be evaluated at
        significantly reduced cost, thereby enabling many-query approximations
        of the inverse solutions for different hyper-parameters and data, while
        the approximation error can be monitored through rigorous and certified
        a posteriori error bounds. Focussing on stability theory results, we
        describe common challenges in these types of RB minimizations, in
        particular regarding Petrov-Galerkin structures and the role of the
        adjoint, and discuss tangible approaches for their mitigation. We
        demonstrate our results on a large-scale geophysical model of the Perth
        Basin, and on a contaminant-dispersion problem over a Taylor-Green
        vortex velocity field.

        In this talk I present a new method to incorporate temporal evolution
        into general reduced-order parametrised models. Instead of following the
        traditional approach of time step sampling, we use frequency-domain
        solutions as the data input. The method works similarly as the Proper
        Orthogonal Decomposition with some key differences. In the offline
        stage, we transfer the problem from the time domain to the frequency
        domain using the Laplace transform, we sample solutions for a discrete
        set of frequencies, and use the Singular Valued Decomposition to
        construct a reduced basis. And in the online stage, we use the obtained
        reduced basis in the time-dependent problem. We discuss two important
        considerations: how to select appropriate sampling points so all the
        needed frequencies are captured, and how the method generates reduced
        bases with orthogonal, complex and symplectic structure.

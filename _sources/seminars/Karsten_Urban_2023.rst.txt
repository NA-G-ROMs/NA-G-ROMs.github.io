    .. container:: sd-badge-next-text

        We present a well-posed ultra-weak space-time variational formulation
        for the time-dependent version of the linear Schrödinger equation with
        an instationary Hamiltonian. We prove optimal inf-sup stability and
        introduce a space-time Petrov-Galerkin discretization with optimal
        discrete inf-sup stability.
        
        We show norm-preservation of the ultra-weak formulation. The inf-sup
        optimal Petrov-Galerkin discretization is shown to be asymptotically
        norm-preserving, where the deviation is shown to be in the order of the
        discretization. In addition, we introduce a Galerkin discretization,
        which has suboptimal inf-sup stability but exact norm-preservation.
        
        Numerical experiments underline the performance of the ultra-weak
        space-time variational formulation, especially for non-smooth initial
        data.

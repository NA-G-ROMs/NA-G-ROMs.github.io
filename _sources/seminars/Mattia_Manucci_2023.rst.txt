        We present a numerical method for efficiently and reliably solving
        parametrized time-dependent partial differential equations (PPDEs). An
        important consideration for the addressed problems is that not all
        dynamics are significant; rather, only the solution at a given final
        time :math:`t = T` or within a time window :math:`[T\Lambda^{-1},\;T]`,
        where :math:`\Lambda > 1`, of moderate size.
        
        In the first part of the talk, methods based on the Laplace transform
        and its numerical inversion are introduced. These methods, also known as
        contour integral methods, are well-suited for solving ordinary
        differential equations (ODEs) that arise from the discretization of
        linear parabolic PDEs. A notable advantage of this approach is that,
        unlike time-stepping methods such as Runge-Kutta integrators, the
        Laplace transform enables direct computation of the solution at a
        specific instant. This can be achieved by approximating the contour
        integral associated with the inverse Laplace transform using a suitable
        quadrature formula. Furthermore, the proposed approach automatically
        yields an approximation of the solution with a prescribed level of
        accuracy.
        
        The second part of the talk discusses a projection model order reduction
        (MOR) method that employs the contour integral methods as a time
        integrator. With respect to some classical MOR methodology, like the one
        based on the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), this
        determines a significant improvement in the reduction phase since the
        number of vectors to which the decomposition applies is drastically
        reduced as it does not contain all intermediate solutions generated
        along an integration grid by a time stepping method.
        
        Finally, the last part is dedicated to the numerically efficient and
        reliable approximation of eigenvalues and singular values associated
        with parametrically dependent matrices. Specifically, the focus lies on
        approximating the smallest eigenvalue and/or singular value, as this is
        crucial for the efficiency of greedy strategies in constructing reduced
        spaces within projection MOR.
